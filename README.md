FastNoiseLite port for Zig
=============================

This is a port of the C++ version of [FastNoiseLite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite) library to Zig. No C library used. Should support `f32` and `f64` input coordinates.
To use it, the easiest is to just copy it into your project.
